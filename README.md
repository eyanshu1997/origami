# origami
This mini project uses these basic Computer graphics concepts to materialize 3D images and thus animate the traditional art of paper folding â€“ Origami to create a paper plane. Functions to make the program interactive for the user have been provided along with those that allow the user to experience an extensive overview of the OpenGL functions.
